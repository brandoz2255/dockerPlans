Honeypot container unique thing to add 

[[Security Testing Lab]] Red team skills

[[Incident Response Lab]] Blue team skills 

- **Honeypot Container:** Attracts and logs cyber-attacks.
- **Security Testing Lab Container:** Hosts vulnerable applications for testing.
- **Red vs Blue Lab Container**: 
- **Incident Response Container:** Simulates a corporate network for incident analysis.

After each workshop day we could make each container together and then finalize it with Kubernetes 



### **1. Develop the Containers First:**

- **Container Development:** Start by building each container individually. This involves setting up the applications, services, and tools within each container.
    - **Honeypot Container:** Configure it with the necessary services (e.g., SSH, HTTP) and logging mechanisms.
    - **Security Testing Lab Container:** Set up vulnerable web apps or services and integrate automated testing tools like OWASP ZAP.
    - **Incident Response Container:** Simulate a corporate environment and integrate forensic tools.
- **Testing and Validation:** Test each container individually to ensure it works as expected. This includes checking for vulnerabilities, ensuring services are properly configured, and verifying that they perform their intended functions.

### **2. Integrate with the CI/CD Pipeline:**

- **CI/CD Setup:** Once your containers are ready, integrate them into a CI/CD pipeline. This will automate the building, testing, and deployment of the containers.
    - **Automated Tests:** Include security scans and other tests in the pipeline to ensure that each container is secure before deployment.
    - **Container Registry:** Push the tested and validated containers to a container registry (like Docker Hub or a private registry) where they can be pulled by Kubernetes.

### **3. Deploy and Manage with Kubernetes:**

- **Kubernetes Setup:** After the containers are built and stored in a registry, you can move on to setting up Kubernetes.
    - **Pod and Deployment Configurations:** Create Kubernetes YAML files (Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc.) that define how each container should be deployed and managed within Kubernetes.
    - **Namespace and Labeling:** Organize your containers within Kubernetes using namespaces and labels, allowing for selective deployment.
    - **Selective Activation:** Implement scripts or a UI to manage which containers are active at any given time.
