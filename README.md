Plan overall but will change


- **Week 1:** Ensure Docker is pre-installed or provide installation instructions.
- **Week 2:** Prepare Dockerfiles and basic images for students to use.
- **Week 3:** Have vulnerability scanning tools set up and ready for demonstration.
- **Week 4:** Prepare a sample `docker-compose.yml` file and test networking setups.
- **Week 5:** Provide guidance on securing Docker images and containers.
